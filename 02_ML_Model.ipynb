# --- Configuration ---
RANDOM_SEED = 42

# --- 1. Load Processed Data ---
try:
    with open('data/processed_data_for_ml.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, feature_names = pickle.load(f)
    print("Successfully loaded processed data and feature names.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("ERROR: Processed data file not found. Please run '01_EDA_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb' first.")

# --- 2. Model Training ---

# Choosing Logistic Regression: It provides probability scores (our RFT Score) and is highly interpretable.
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=RANDOM_SEED, solver='liblinear')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("\nLogistic Regression Model Training Complete.")

# --- 3. Model Evaluation ---

# Predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Probability score for RFT (our Pre-Screen Score)

# Evaluation Metrics
print("\n--- Model Performance on Test Set (30% Unseen Data) ---")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Interpretation: Focus on the F1-Score for the '1' class (Right-First-Time).
# A high F1-score means the model is good at correctly identifying RFT applications.

# --- 4. Feature Importance (Interpretability) ---
# Logistic Regression coefficients show the relative importance/impact of each feature
coefficients = pd.Series(model.coef_[0], index=feature_names).sort_values(ascending=False)
print("\n--- Feature Impact on Right-First-Time Likelihood ---")
print(coefficients)

# Interpretation: Positive values (e.g., high turnover) increase the RFT score.
# Negative values (e.g., missing documents) significantly decrease the RFT score.

# --- 5. Save the Trained Model ---
MODEL_FILE = 'models/rft_prescreen_model.pkl'

# Ensure the 'models' directory exists
import os
os.makedirs('models', exist_ok=True)

with open(MODEL_FILE, 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)
print(f"\nTrained RFT Pre-Screen Model successfully saved to '{MODEL_FILE}'")

# Save the feature names separately, which is critical for consistency
with open('models/feature_names.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(feature_names, file)
print("Feature names saved.")
